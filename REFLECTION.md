# Reflection

The main choice I made when developing this project was to use the Oak framework for the backend api. This was not because I wanted better performance—the built-in Deno server is more performant than any other framework in the ecosystem—but rather because I preferred having more modularity and a more organized file and folder structure on the backend.
