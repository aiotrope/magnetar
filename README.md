The online Q&A platform is intended for coursework-related queries and responses. The site allows you to choose a course, ask questions about it, and provide replies. There is also the option to upvote the questions and replies. Anyone can publish questions and answers, and anyone can upvote them, allowing for anonymous involvement. The platform uses big language models to generate replies to inquiries in order to deliver further answers.
